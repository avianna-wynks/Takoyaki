# Takoyaki

This is a two-player card game where ten cards are placed face down in front of either player, and then the rest of the deck is placed in the center of the table. Players take turns flipping a card over from the middle deck. The number on the card determines which cards you can flip. The first one to flip over all their cards wins.
